## Introduction
Autominy is an autonomous model vehicle (scale 1:10) developed at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin for educational and research purposes. The car is an on-board complete system supplied with perception sensors such as infrared stereo camera and LIDAR, feedback sensors including position of steering angle and motor encoder, high computing CPU and GPU power as well as LEDs to emulate car lights, Autominy is designed as a self sufficient system that requires no external sensing or computing, it can be controlled remotely (e.g. with a smartphone or XBox controller) or can be programmed to drive in fully autonomous mode. The car runs on ROS noetic on Ubuntu 20.04.
