### Setting up ROS2
These instructions assume that you are running Ubuntu 24.04. Install ROS2 jazzy using the installation guide at the [ROS2 jazzy documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html). At the end of that tutorial you will have a working ROS2 installation onto which the autominy packages will be installed.
