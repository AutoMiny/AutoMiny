### Setting up ROS
These instructions assume that you are running Ubuntu 18.04. Install ROS
melodic using the installation guide at the
[ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu). At the end of that tutorial you will have a working ROS installation onto which the autominy packages will be installed.
