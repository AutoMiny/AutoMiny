With the aim of having precise characteristics of the model of the car, we include the following  table. The physical variables such as velocity and acceleration were obtained using a fully charged LiPo battery which reported 15.8V during the tests.

| Name                                        | Value                   |
|:--------------------------------------------|:------------------------|
| Dimensions                                  | 387,5mm x 160mm x 270mm |
| Weight (core, nano, xavier)                 | Kg, Kg, Kg              |
| Power consumption (core, nano, xavier)      | 80W, 85W, 90W           |
| Max. power consumption (core, nano, xavier) | 112W, 122W, 142W        |
| Max. velocity forwards                      | 2.5 m/s                 |
| Max. velocity backwards                     | -2.5 m/s                |
| Max. acceleration forwards                  | m/s²                    |
| Max. acceleration backwards                 | m/s²                    |
